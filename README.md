# RayTracer
Another ray tracer. 

### Structure
I use Eigen library for primitive type definitions (such as colors, points, and rays). This is useful since Eigen already provides many accelerated operations on vector and matrix types. 

### Useful compile commands
```
g++ src/main.cpp -o test -v
```
